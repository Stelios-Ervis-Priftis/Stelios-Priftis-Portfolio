						<h2>About Stelios</h2>
						<p>Iâ€™m a Front - End Developer with a background in Sound Engineering.</p>
						<p>
							When I was working as a Sound Engineer I was curious about how software programs work. So I started
							doing some research and I bumped into an enormous amount of courses and information about coding
							and what you can achieve with it.
						</p>
						<p>
							After dabbling with code in my spare time, I realise I was hooked and decided to take a BootCamp
							course in order to learn how to code properly. This has exposed me to full-stack technologies
							culminating in several projects.
						</p>
						<p>
							I would like to work closely with an experienced mentor to continue building my skills, further
							grow and develop my love for coding. Currently, I am looking for a job opportunity in the field as
							a Front - End Developer that will give me all the opportunities for growth, both personally and
							professionally.

									Snowboarding is my winter passion. The sensation of carving down pristine slopes, surrounded

									where each ride becomes a canvas for self-expression. Snowboarding it's a lifelong love

								<h1>Mixology</h1>
								<p>
									Mixology is my enthralling hobby, a delightful blend of art and flavours. Crafting exquisite
									cocktails is like composing a symphony of flavors, with each ingredient playing a unique role
									in the palate's symphony. It's a creative pursuit that allows me to experiment, innovate, and
									surprise, whether I'm concocting classic cocktails or inventing my own signature libations.
									Mixology it's a captivating journey through the world of spirits and mixers, where every
									drink tells a story of taste and craftsmanship.
