# Recipe App

### General Info

Recipe App is a basic CRUD (Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete) application that is created entirely with vanilla JavaScript.

It allows users to create new recipes, add, delete, update necessary ingredients and allows the user to track their ingredients by checking/unchecked them. It also gives user a feedback about their ingredients and when they possessing give the opportunity on the user to hit the button Cook It and that as a result will give a like point on the recipe, as an indication of that recipe is been cooked and how many times as a tracking results.

The app also saves recipes and ingredients thus the user can freely visit the website sometime later and pick up where he/she left.

This project is created to put my vanilla JavaScript skills in practice. It is also the last challenge that is presented in **The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp (2019)** by [Andrew Mead](https://mead.io/) on **Udemy**.

Despite the project being introduced in an online course, there is no solution provided by the instructor.
