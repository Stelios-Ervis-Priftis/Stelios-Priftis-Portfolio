# Todo App

### General Info

Todo App is a classic tracker that list things that you need toto the application is created entirely with vanilla JavaScript.

It allows users to create and add todo, list all todos, search for a specific todo, hide the completed todos so you can track what's next, remove individual todo if has been completed and gives you feedback on how many incomplete you have left.

The app also saves the todos thus use can freely visit the website sometime later and pick up where he/she left.

This project is created to put my vanilla JavaScript skills in practice. It is also one of the guided full of challenges projects that is presented in **The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp (2019)** by [Andrew Mead](https://mead.io/) on **Udemy**.
