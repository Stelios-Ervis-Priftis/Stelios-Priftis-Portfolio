### Description

Random Quote Machine is a basic quote generator.

It calls API services and randomly generates a quote for you from a click press of a button New Quote. As a result it will render a new quote for you and colors will change every time you generate a new quote.

This project is created to put my React skills in practice. It is also designed as a freeCodeCamp certification project for Front End Libraries Projects, **Build a Random Quote Machine** by [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/#front-end-libraries-projects) on **FreeCodeCamp**.
