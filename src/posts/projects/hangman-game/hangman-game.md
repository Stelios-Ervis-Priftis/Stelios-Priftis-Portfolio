# Hangman Game

A well known paper and pencil drowning game in an web version that is created entirely with vanilla Javascript.

It allow the users to guess the word by typing on hes/hers keyboard.
Every word is been fetched from an API which contains a plethora of word and different difficulties that will put the user in challenge.

This project is created to put my vanilla Javascript skills to practice. It is also one of the guided full of challenges projects that is presented in **The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp (2019)** by [Andrew Mead](https://mead.io/) on **Udemy**.
