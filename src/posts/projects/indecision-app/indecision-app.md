This project is been created for educational peruses while I was enrolling a React course.

Despite the project being introduced in an online course that being guided by the tutor, they where a tone of challenges and the end results that you can see in the **Indecision App** from styling, third party libraries choices and some additional functionalities where my own personal practices and curiosities during the tutoring of the course on the subject introduction in React.
