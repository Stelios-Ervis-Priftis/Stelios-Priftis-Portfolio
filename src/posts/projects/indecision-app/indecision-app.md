# Indecision App

### General Info

Indecision is a web app that helps you make a decision and randomly choose one of the given options for you.

It allows the users to add as many options as they want, to delete one that doesn't meet the purpose or delete all them off and start listing new options. When you list all the options you want, you just press the button COMPUTER TAKE DECISION and voil√†!

No more arguments on which movie or series should you watch tonight.

This project was created for educational purposes while I enrolled in React course. It is one of the projects that is presented in **The Complete React Developer Course (w/ Hooks and Redux)** by [Andrew Mead](https://mead.io/) on **Udemy**.

Despite the project being introduced in an online course that is guided by the tutor, there where a tone of challenges. The end results, that you can see in the **Indecision App**, such as styling, from third party library's choices and some additional functionalities where my own personal practices and curiosities that occurred during the tutoring of the course on the subject introduction in React.
